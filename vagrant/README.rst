===============================


From this repository, just run 'vagrant up' and go to http://localhost:8080 in
your browser when provisionning is finished. Login to SaltPad using vagrant/vagrant.

Please be sure to have an up-to-date vagrant or you may hit vagrant bugs like https://github.com/tinyclues/saltpad/issues/104.
