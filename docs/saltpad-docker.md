# SaltPad docker

Saltpad includes both a Dockerfile for creating a saltpad docker image and a docker-compose environement for you to play with.


# Saltpad with docker-compose


You can setup automatically a salt-api with salt-master and salt-minion for testing saltpad safely without impacting your production. It is also required for the moment as saltpad requires develop version of salt-api.

The image generated for salt-api will contains the latest develop version of salt, a salt-master, a salt-minion and two salt-api running in HTTP.

The salt-api running rest_cherrypy will run on port 8000 and should be available on your host with the same port, so you can put ```localhost:8000``` for ```API_URL``` in your file ```settings.json```.

The salt-api running rest_tornado will run on port 5417 and should be available on your host with the same port, so you can put ```localhost:5417``` for ```API_URL``` in your file ```settings.json```.

Depending on your setup, these ports may need to be mapped manually (like for example with docker-machine and virtualbox) or available on a different host (like with dlite). You can try to access via your browser on the salt-api URLs before trying to run saltpad, if they are not accessible via your browser, saltpad will not works.

## Build

It's very similar as for docker alone.

**Don't forget to create the ```settings.json``` file first** question 1? how does one write a settings.json for TWO API_URL s? question 2? which Dockerfile is thise expecting to use? (or in which directory should I be in?

```
docker-compose build
```

### Execute salt commands

If you need to execute salt commands on the salt-master, you can execute this command to launch a bash inside the salt-master container:

```
docker exec -t -i $(docker ps | grep "salt-api" | cut -d " " -f 1) bash
```

## Run

```
docker-compose run
```

# Saltpad with docker-compose and salt-api stable

There is an alternative Docker image that use salt-api stable instead of develop version.

The configuration is the same than the one on develop version, but it can help you test saltpad against a stable version of salt-api. For now, only the rest_cherrypy deployment works against the stable version, so you need to put ```localhost:8000``` for ```API_URL``` and ```/saltpad/``` for ```PATH_PREFIX``` in your file ```settings.json```. You will also need to build saltpad first, using the command ```npm run build```.  Question 3? where in which envrionment or in which docker container is this to be done? Sorry I find this is jumping about, and I am lost?

Please refer to the main README for more informations on the subject. Question 4? this does not make sense? maybe content from readme has been moved out? can you actually link to the section you are referring to?

Uncomment the right ```dockerfile``` line in docker-compose.yml (the one actually commented), build the docker images with ```docker-compose build```, launch them with ```docker-compose up``` then access ```http://localhost:8000/saltpad``` to have access to saltpad.

# Saltpad docker image Question 5? which Dockerfile is this section dealing with?

The dockerfile will build a docker container to run saltpad in. It will use the file ```settings.json``` to configure
the container.

**Note: This will need more work to run in production, for now - only use for development.**

**Note: This will not setup your salt-master's salt-api or other requisites to be able to talke to salt, it only runs SaltPad. If you need a salt-api and salt-master for testing scroll up to saltpad with docker-compose**

## Build

You can build a saltpad image which will package the current version of the code located on your copy of this repository.

**Don't forget to create the ```settings.json``` file first** Question 6? which API_URL is expected here? 5417 or 8000 or both like above? Does this need to link or point to a IP on the salt-api container?

```
docker build -t name/saltpad:latest .
```

## Run

After building it, you can launch it with this command:

```
docker run -p 3333:3333 name/saltpad:latest
```
